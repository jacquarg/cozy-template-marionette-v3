A template for Cozy app using marionette JS

# Howto hack this app

TODO !

You'll need a valid node.js/npm environment to develop the app. We use [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) as build tool. Before trying to develop the app, you need to load its dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

#### Librairies

You should be aware of the app libraries in use:
* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) is used for a quick and valid components architecture, like models
* [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/) is the framework used upon Backbone to have a more clever and easier way to deal with views (like layouts, regions, and views switching)
